### What is this for?

This is a tool that helps you ask "technical questions" and track how well a candidate answered and how they answered. Any notes are better than no notes. When you're done export them as markdown and do what you need to do.

### What isn't this for?

It's not a quiz. If you don't have an answer in mind, you should probably not ask these questions. It's a tool for discussion. Nobody needs to know everything. Nobody does.

### Can I add more questions?

Feel free to submit PRs against this. If you fork and never tell anyone, that's fine too. But help everyone out and make this question set better. It's not rocket science.
